      <h1>Satyajit Ray with Camera</h1>
      <p>
        Towering above Central Avenue, this black-and-white face commands reverence: Satyajit Ray, India’s legendary filmmaker, peering through his camera.This mural is not merely an homage but a cultural marker. Ray’s cinema in the 1950s and ’60s (with films like Pather Panchali) introduced the world to Bengal’s poverty and resilience, but also its poetry. His camera was never just a lens—it was an instrument that gave dignity to the struggles of common people. Painted with bold strokes and backlit by colors of modernity, this graffiti reminds us that Kolkata is Ray’s city, a place where cinema became literature, and streets became storyboards. It’s fitting that the mural faces a busy thoroughfare—thousands of eyes meet Ray’s gaze daily, and in a sense, every passerby becomes part of his eternal cinema.
